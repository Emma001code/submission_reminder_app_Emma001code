# I created a parent directory, subdirectories and a directory structure 

# moved into the parent directory that I created earlier using my cd command 

# I entered the path of the content I want to add in the subdorectories using my cat command to fill the subdirectories content 

# I  made the reminder and function script executable 

# I appended the submissions.txt with five names using my skills to append it to the previous ones in the files 

# I created the startup.sh and populated with the command that will verify the reminder.sh file  and implements it
